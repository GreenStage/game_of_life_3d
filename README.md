3D Game of Life

Parallel and Distributed Computation project by: 
Afonso Fernandes, Eduardo Gomes (GreenStage), João Amado (amadilsons)

This program was elaborated as a project for the subject Parallel Distribution and Computation.

It consists on implementing a three dimensional Game of Life according to the rules specified in the file projPDC1617-life3d.pdf.

It receives as input a file with the description (in coordinates x, y, z) of the initial cell's population and the number of generations to compute.

The objective was to make this program as fast as possible and parallalezible for multithreading.

Currently there are two serial versions of the program. A matrix version created by Eduardo Gomes (GreenStage) and an hashtable version created by João Amado (amadilsons).
Both are fully functional, fast solutions.
